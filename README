These are disassembled Game Boy boot ROMs.

Compile them with rgbds: https://rednex.github.io/rgbds/

Once theyâ€™ve been compiled, dmg0.bin, dmg.bin, mgb.bin, sgb.bin, and sgb2.bin
must be trimmed to 256 bytes each. stadium_mgb.bin and stadium_cgb.bin do not
require trimming.

stadium_mgb: 0x15994A0
stadium_cgb: 0x15995F0
